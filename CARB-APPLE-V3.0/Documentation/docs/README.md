2. Set up Blueprint 3 (Lead Capture) - 30 min
3. Set up Blueprint 2 (Test Complete) - 1 hour
4. Set up Blueprint 1 (Morning Blog) - 1 hour

**Result:** Content writing automated, leads captured, reports sent instantly

### Phase 2: Validation (THIS MONTH) 📊
**Goal:** Measure time saved

**Action:**
1. Decide: Build yourself (React Native) or hire contractor
2. Start with VIN scanner + photo capture + report generation
3. Beta test with 5 testers (TestFlight)
4. Submit to App Store (2-4 week review)

**Result:** iOS app live, using yourself daily

### Phase 4: Monetize (MONTHS 5-6) 💰
**Goal:** First 10 paying customers

## Questions & Next Steps

### Common Questions

**Q: Should I build the full "Google Workspace for Testers" now?**
A: NO. Start with Make.com automations (no coding, deploy this week). Validate AI saves you time. THEN build iOS app around proven workflows.

**Q: What should I build first?**
A: Nothing! Set up Make.com automations (Blueprint 3: Lead Capture). Takes 30 min, $0, proves the concept.

**Q: How do I get the PNG icons?**
A: Open `/generate-icons.html` in browser, click buttons, right-click and save PNGs. Or use the SVG in `/public/icon.svg` with any converter.

**Q: When should I hire a developer?**
A: After you've used Make.com automations for 1 month and KNOW they save you time. Don't build the app in the dark.

**Q: How long until I can launch on App Store?**
A: If starting today: 3-4 months (build) + 2-4 weeks (Apple review) = 4-5 months total
